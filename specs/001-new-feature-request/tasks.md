# Tasks: AI转录功能完整性检查

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-new-feature-request/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Tests (T005-T014) before implementation (T015-T027)
- Database model (T015) blocks all data-dependent tasks
- API endpoints (T021-T025) depend on their corresponding test files
- UI components (T028-T035) can be developed in parallel after core implementation
- Integration tasks (T036-T040) depend on both core and UI components
- Polish tasks (T045-T052) after all implementation complete

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Contract Tests (T005-T009)
```
# Launch these contract tests together:
Task: "Contract test POST /api/health-check/run in src/app/api/health-check/run.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/health-check/status/{checkId} in src/app/api/health-check/status.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/health-check/results/{checkId} in src/app/api/health-check/results.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/health-check/reports in src/app/api/health-check/reports.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test PUT /api/health-check/config in src/app/api/health-check/config.test.ts"
```

### Example 2: Core Check Implementations (T016-T020)
```
# Launch these check implementations in parallel:
Task: "API connectivity check implementation in src/lib/health-check/checks/api-connectivity.ts"
Task: "Error handling validation in src/lib/health-check/checks/error-handling.ts"
Task: "Performance benchmarking in src/lib/health-check/checks/performance.ts"
Task: "User experience validation in src/lib/health-check/checks/user-experience.ts"
Task: "Security compliance check in src/lib/health-check/checks/security.ts"
```

### Example 3: UI Component Development (T028-T035)
```
# Launch these UI components together:
Task: "Health check dashboard in src/components/health-check/HealthCheckDashboard.tsx"
Task: "Check runner component in src/components/health-check/CheckRunner.tsx"
Task: "Report viewer in src/components/health-check/ReportViewer.tsx"
Task: "Settings manager in src/components/health-check/SettingsManager.tsx"
Task: "Notification manager in src/components/health-check/NotificationManager.tsx"
Task: "Status indicator component in src/components/health-check/StatusIndicator.tsx"
Task: "Metrics card component in src/components/health-check/MetricsCard.tsx"
Task: "Progress bar component in src/components/health-check/ProgressBar.tsx"
```

### Example 4: Unit Tests (T045-T047)
```
# Launch these unit tests in parallel:
Task: "Unit tests for database operations in src/lib/health-check/database.test.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for report generation in src/lib/health-check/report-generator.test.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for UI components in src/components/health-check/*.test.tsx"
```

## Critical Path
The critical path for implementation is:
1. **Setup** (T001-T004) → **Tests First** (T005-T014) → **Core Implementation** (T015-T027) → **Integration** (T036-T040) → **Polish** (T045-T052)

## Quality Gates
- All tests must fail before implementation (TDD approach)
- Code coverage must be > 80% for all health check modules
- Performance benchmarks must meet specified targets (<5 minutes total check time)
- All UI components must pass accessibility tests
- API responses must meet <2 second response time requirement

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, safe for parallel execution
- Verify tests fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow constitutional requirements: local data privacy, PWA support, multi-AI service integration
- Ensure error handling covers all edge cases identified in research phase
