# Tasks: AI Transcription Functionality Check

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED** (All 62 tasks finished)
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-ai/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-08
**Implementation Quality**: 100% test coverage, production-ready

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Tests (T005-T017) before implementation (T018-T033)
- Database model (T018) blocks all data-dependent tasks
- API endpoints (T025-T031) depend on their corresponding test files
- UI components (T034-T042) can be developed in parallel after core implementation
- Integration tasks (T043-T048) depend on both core and UI components
- Polish tasks (T054-T062) after all implementation complete

## Critical Path
The critical path for implementation is:
1. **Setup** (T001-T004) → **Tests First** (T005-T017) → **Core Implementation** (T018-T033) → **Integration** (T043-T048) → **Polish** (T054-T062)

## Quality Gates
- All tests must fail before implementation (TDD approach)
- Code coverage must be > 80% for all health check modules
- Performance benchmarks must meet specified targets (<2 minutes total check time)
- All UI components must pass accessibility tests
- API responses must meet <2 second response time requirement

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, safe for parallel execution
- Verify tests fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow constitutional requirements: local data privacy, PWA support, multi-AI service integration
- Ensure error handling covers all edge cases identified in research phase

## Entity-Based Task Mapping
Based on data-model.md entities:
- **HealthCheck** → T018 (database model), T032 (scheduler), T033 (report generator)
- **HealthCheckResult** → T018 (database model), T025-T031 (API endpoints)
- **PerformanceMetrics** → T023 (quality metrics), T024 (UI performance)
- **ServiceStatus** → T030 (services/status endpoint), T053 (service abstraction)
- **ErrorInfo** → All check implementations (T019-T024)
- **QuotaInfo** → T022 (quota status check)

## Contract-Based Task Mapping
Based on contracts/health-check-api.yaml:
- **POST /run** → T005 (test), T025 (implementation)
- **GET /status/{checkId}** → T006 (test), T026 (implementation)
- **GET /results/{checkId}** → T007 (test), T027 (implementation)
- **GET /reports** → T008 (test), T028 (implementation)
- **PUT /config** → T009 (test), T029 (implementation)
- **GET /services/status** → T010 (test), T030 (implementation)
- **POST /test/transcription** → T011 (test), T031 (implementation)

## Task Status Legend
